Bug Log

Only one keyboard interrupt fires
	PIC was sending EOI in wrong format 
-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	


Separate file for assembly linkage of interrupt handlers causing double inclusion / not functioning
	Instead used inline assembly to simplify process 
-	Found by Arnav, fixed by Brandon


RTC seems to not get set to the correct frequencies
	Frequency was being written into Register A instead of the rate 
-	Found by Mohammed, fixed by Mohammed

Reading from “.” doesn’t call directory read function
	I don’t think it  even finds “.” <- search started with 2nd entry
	Now finds “.”, pagefaults on second read <- Bug with test code
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon


Shift / Caps/ Shift and caps functionality buggy
	Ordering of conditional statements mattered, the shift & caps branch was getting skipped, needed to be placed at the top of the conditional 
	-	Found by Greg, fixed by Arnav 


Compile warning: file_ops and dir_ops unused
	They actually are used. Not sure why it’s warning.
	I’m thinking about just moving all file_operations structs to a table anyways.
	marked as unused 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	


Security- memory not cleared after halt, so it could be scraped
	Memory now cleared on halt 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon

Jump tables not properly loading for OCRW type specific system calls 
	Various syntax errors were fixed to load jump tables in open system call 
	-	Found by Arnav, fixed by Arnav
	

No interrupts trigger after a system call
	System call gate not set properly to clear IF (should have used interrupt gate instead of trap gate)
	-	Found by Arnav & Brandon, fixed by Arnav


Processes halt system after fault TA found
	Fixed by changing calls to fail to halt 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	


Terminal only reads first char 
	Line_buf_index is reset to 0 early
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	


Halt sometimes returns to parent of parent
	Esp0 was stored incorrectly 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	 


Exec does not check for null command pointer TA found
	Exec now checks for null pointer 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	


Fish runs slower when running in multiple terminals
	RTC now has separate flag for each terminal 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon

RTC is not outputting varying rates
	Test case was incorrect. Buffer was getting passed in incorrectly. Fixed by passing in pointer of buffer
	-	Found by Mohammed, fixed by Mohammed

Read, write, open, close for terminal and RTC are not being called
	Terminal and RTC function signatures were changed to match file system function signature, which matches the system call signatures for read, write, open, and close 
	-	Found by Mohammed, fixed by Mohammed

Stack was being corrupted by assembly linkage
	Popped too many 
	-	Found by TA, fixed by Arnav

Execute fails with space after arguments
	Fixed 
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Brandon	


ALT+Function-Keys not functioning
	We were trying to find the function-keys from the keyboard characters but we merely had to just analyze the scancode itself to match F1, F2, F3
	-	Found by Mohammed, fixed by Mohammed


Video memory not getting mapped correctly to each terminal
	Three different video tables were made to account for each video memory for each terminal in multiple terminals implementation
	-	Found by Brandon, fixed by Greg


Characters are not deleting after first line is printed out
	Negative numbers do not work with mod function so instead an if statement fixed it
	-	Found by Greg, fixed by Greg
